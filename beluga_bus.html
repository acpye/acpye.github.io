								<h1><a href="index.html">Beluga Bus </a></h1>
								<p>This was a group submission for the November Three Thing Game jam, an internal game jam hosted by the University of Hull, and came second place.
                                    Participants are given three words and must make a game around that theme, with our team being given the words: Underwater, Bus, and Blossom.
									The player controls a beluga "bus" that drives around picking up passengers and dropping them off at their destination.
									At the end of each day a player receives a score, and are able to progress to the next day. This repeats until they fail to reach the ever increasing target score.
									There is an online leaderboard for players to compare and compete for the highest score.
                                    The project was made in Unity with C#, and can be played on itch.io at the link below on both mobile and desktop:
